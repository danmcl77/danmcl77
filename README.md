### Hello 👋 I'm Dan McLachlan

I'm an astrophysics PhD student at Charles University in Prague with an MSc from the University of Galway/NUI Galway.

- 🌳 Proficient in Python, currently learning Fortran and improving on bash scripting and the joys of working on supercomputer clusters
- 🔭 Experience working with resolved images of circumstellar disks in infrared from VLT/SPHERE and in mm regime with ALMA
- 🔭 Currently learning spectroscopic techniques, radioastronomy fundamentals, radiative transfer modelling and more useful skills
- 🌱 Also make some fun little programs for whatever strikes my fancy at any given time
- 💬 Ask me about circumstellar matter, and talk to me about music - this will make me happy :)
