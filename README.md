### Hello 👋 I'm Dan McLachlan

I'm a physics graduate from the University of Galway/NUI Galway. I'm interested in all things space-related - particularly gas kinematics, star formation and planetary nebulae. 
I also enjoy technical challenges, any opportunity to exercise the grey cells.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a rowing performance measuring app for a startup I co-founded
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning how to make tri-colour image composites from space telescope data
- 💬 Ask me about space or music (particularly jazz)
