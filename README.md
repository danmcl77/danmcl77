### Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dan McLachlan

<!--
**danmcl77/danmcl77** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a physics graduate from the University of Galway/NUI Galway. I'm interested in all things space-related - particularly gas kinematics, star formation and planetary nebulae. 
I also enjoy technical challenges, any opportunity to exercise the grey cells.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a rowing performance measuring app for a startup I co-founded
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently re-learning how to make tri-colour image composites from space telescope data
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about space or music
