### Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dan McLachlan

I'm a physics graduate from the University of Galway/NUI Galway. I'm interested in all things space-related - particularly gas kinematics, star formation and planetary nebulae. 
I also enjoy technical challenges, any opportunity to exercise the grey cells.

- ðŸŒ³ I am proficient in Python programming
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a rowing performance measuring app for a startup I co-founded
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently re-learning how to make tri-colour image composites from space telescope data
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Selenium and C in order to bolster my technical skillset (hopefully some examples of projects I'm working on up soon!)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about space or music (particularly jazz)
