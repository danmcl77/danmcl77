### Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dan McLachlan

I'm an astrophysics master's student (soon to be PhD student at Charles University in Prague!) from the University of Galway/NUI Galway. I'm interested in all things space-related - particularly gas kinematics, star formation, planet formation and planetary nebulae. 
I also enjoy technical challenges, any opportunity to exercise the grey cells.

- ðŸŒ³ I am proficient in Python programming
- ðŸ”­ Primarily focusing on infrared resolved image astronomy with a light sprinkling of radio astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Also make fun little programs for processing space telescope images
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about space or music (particularly jazz)
